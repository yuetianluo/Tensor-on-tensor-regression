This is the code for paper "Tensor-on-Tensor Regression: Riemannian Optimization, Over-parameterization, Statistical-computational Gap, and Their Interplay" by Yuetian Luo, and Anru R. Zhang (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08756). See README.md for the instruction.

Required package: tensor_toolbox (https://www.tensortoolbox.org/)

This folder includes codes of Riemannian gradient descent and Riemannian Gauss-Newton for three problems: matrix trace regression, scalar-on-tensor regression and tensor-on-vector regression. For each example, we include an example code under each setting and those file names are ended with 'example'.

Each subfolder includes the code to reproceduce the result in the corresponding simulation section in the paper.
